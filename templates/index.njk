            A year ago my day job involved listening to other people talk about
            all the reasons their current job was unsatisfying and why retraining
            as a software developer was the right move for them. For some people
            it was about job security, others wanted a job with more of a
            challenge, or more flexibility, or more money.

            On the evening of my second day at CodeClan I ended up at hospital at
            midnight because my eight month old daughter was having trouble breathing.
            She was fine, but we all got about three hours of sleep. The next few nights
            I stayed up hours later than I usually would reading around the topics
            we'd covered in class. That weekend I caught the flu.</a>
