              For the past four weeks I’ve been immersed in all things Java. Compared to Ruby, the language we focused on in our first module, Java is strict and fairly verbose. At first it seemed like it required a lot of extra gumpf than Ruby to achieve basically the same result.

              Over weeks three and four of my course at CodeClan we moved from things I felt comfortable with, loops and control flow, to things I felt sure I could learn, classes and object oriented programming, to things I didn't know enough about to even begin imagining how I might fare, SQL.

              On the evening of my second day at CodeClan I ended up at hospital at midnight because my eight month old daughter was having trouble breathing. She was fine, but we all got about three hours of sleep. The next few nights I stayed up hours later than I usually would reading around the topics we'd covered in class. That weekend I caught the flu.

              A year ago my day job involved listening to other people talk about all the reasons their current job was unsatisfying and why retraining as a software developer was the right move for them. For some people it was about job security, others wanted a job with more of a challenge, or more flexibility, or more money.
