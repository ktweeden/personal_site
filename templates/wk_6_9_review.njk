        <p>For the past four weeks I’ve been immersed in all things Java. Compared
          to Ruby, the language we focused on in our first module, Java is strict
          and fairly verbose. At first it seemed to required a lot of extra
          gumpf than Ruby to achieve basically the same result. As we learned more,
          though, I started to appreciate the structures that Java enforces and
          the benefits they afforded. This became more pronounced as we moved from learning
          about how to take the concepts we learned in the first module and translate
          them into Java, to concepts and approaches that are specific to Java.</p>

        <p>In our third week of the module we also got introduced to android. I
          missed the first day of this due to illness and when I returned it was
          like everyone was speaking an entirely different language: I don’t think
          I’d quite appreciated just how much we cover each day before that point.
          I thoroughly enjoyed android, even more so once I explored it further during
          my project. It was incredibly satisfying when I started to understand how
          the different elements that comprise android apps hang together and could
          use that knowledge to research and learn other features that we didn’t
          cover in class.</p>

        <p>There’s also something undeniably cool about having an app on your
          phone that you built from scratch.</p>


        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Having said all that, there were times that I really struggled during
          this module.</p>

        <p>I firmly believe that bettering myself and taking the time to learn
          is just as important to my role as a parent as anything directly
          involving the care and management of the baby. Even if it wasn’t, I am
          a human being with needs that extend far beyond the “mother” part of
          my identity. Doing this course is allowing me to develop a career, to
          expand my understanding of the world and, most importantly, live a
          fulfilled life. </p>

        <p>Throughout the Ruby module we often finished classes quite early and
          I was therefore able to complete my homework before leaving to pick my
          daughter up from nursery. During the Java module we began to finish
          later and I rarely had time to complete my homework at CodeClan. This
          meant starting work after Ada’s bedtime, feeding myself, sorting out
          the next day’s nursery bag and all the other adulting tasks that I used
          to ignore before having a baby but I guess I have to do now. My ability
          to think through problems is inversely proportional to my tiredness
          levels (like most people), so homeworks began taking longer, I was
          staying up later, and I wasn’t getting the rest I needed to approach
          the following day with a clear head.</p>

        <p>It would be nice if I could now say that I found a perfect solution,
          an extra 7 hours in the day for example, and everything is back to
          being only fun. That’s not how life works, so instead I’m just working
          on reminding myself that a. this is so unbelievably right for me that
          it makes the hard parts worth it, and b. in the grand scheme of my
          life this is a very short period and I will miss it when it’s over.</p>
