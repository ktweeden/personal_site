        <p>A year ago my day job involved listening to other people talk about
          all the reasons their current job was unsatisfying and why retraining
          as a software developer was the right move for them. For some people
          it was about job security, others wanted a job with more of a
          challenge, or more flexibility, or more money.</p>

        <p>I would have this conversation five times a day and it was never
          dull. I enjoyed hearing people&#8217;s backstories, how the events of their
          lives led to this point, facing me, hoping to gain a place on the
          course I was interviewing them for. My job was to project forward:
          how will this person cope with the intensity of the course? What
          support might they need to find a job afterwards? Can we help them
          find a fulfilling career, that gives them something their experiences
          so far haven&#8217;t?<p>

        <p>It doesn&#8217;t take many days of asking others whether they&#8217;re
          satisfied with their careers to turn that reflection on yourself. I
          enjoyed my job: the people were nice, the work was varied, and I was fairly
          autonomous. But, it didn&#8217;t have a clear trajectory. I found it
          difficult to imagine where it might lead me in 10, 5 or even 2 years.
          Some of the things I was hearing in that interview room started to
          resonate with me</p>


        <p>Myspace pretty much passed me by (although I&#8217;m not sure why, I was a
          teenager at the right time, and I was certainly emo enough…). The
          thrill of having what was essentially a tamagotchi(!) but on the
          internet(!!), however, was too much for me to ignore so I did have a
          neopets account. I remember taking notes on HTML from their handy
          guide, presumably in various pastel shades of gel pens and spending
          hours getting my page just so.</p>

        <p>Since then, I have dabbled on and off with programming: a codecademy
          course here, a blog theme there. I&#8217;ve always sought out the most
          technical elements of decidedly un-technical jobs, weasiling my way
          into web admin roles, and even convincing one manager to put “Digital”
          in my title. It wasn&#8217;t until a two years ago, though, that I started
          spending large swathes of time learning how to program. I love both
          the big picture, design problems that development poses as well as
          the nitty, gritty, bang your head against the wall, oh god it was a
          typo all along problems.</p>

        <p>But, I have lots of hobbies. I knit but I don&#8217;t want to create
          textiles full time. I cook but I don&#8217;t want to be a chef. Although if
          there&#8217;s a job out there where I can pursue my hobby of napping full
          time then I&#8217;m there. The reason I want to pursue software development
          is because of the huge range of problems it gives me the potential to
          solve, or at least help solve. To the people coming in to hear a
          little more about the course I&#8217;m about to start I used to say that
          the “technology sector” isn&#8217;t the right term. Really, you&#8217;re learning
          a skill that you can apply to all sectors where technology is used
          heavily. Or more succinctly, all sectors.</p>

        <p>So, why now. I could be really cliched and say I had a baby. She
          changed my life and made me question every decision I&#8217;ve ever made as
          well as every decision anyone I&#8217;ve ever met has ever made. Being up
          every 2 hours night after night will do that to a person.</p>
